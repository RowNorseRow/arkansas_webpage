# Arkansas Sports Webpage

## Description 
#### I have made a basic webpage mockup for one of my favorite sports teams. The main purpose of this was to design a site that was very responsive to multiple devices. You can see as you adjust the screen size, the layout changes significantly to better suit the users experience. 

## Contents

  - `Start`
    - This contains all the files necessary in the directory, including all the html and css files. 
    
  - `index.html`
    - This is the executable html file and also contains all the html code when opened with your text editor. 
    
  - `main.css`
    - This is the file that contains all of the css for the main page, without any responsive css added. 
    
  - `responsive.css` 
    - This is the file that contains all of the css for making the webpage responsive.
    
#### All of these files can be opened with your choice of text editor. 

## Instructions
